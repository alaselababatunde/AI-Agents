# About Alash Chat

**Alash Chat** is built by Alasela Babatunde as part of his journey into conversational AI UI/UX design. The project aims to mimic the flow of real-world chatbots like ChatGPT while retaining full control and open-source flexibility.

This frontend is designed to:
- Integrate with AI backends (LLMs, Ollama, RAG systems, Flask)
- Simulate a clean conversation UI with memory
- Serve as a starting point for future projects like Cura AI

---

## Goals
- Help developers design chatbot interfaces easily
- Provide a clean base for AI startups or students
